## Section 4: Charts and APIs

For this section, I created two dashboards to display a visualisation representation of the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore over time.
For the dashboard illustrated in the png file: `COVID19 (1).png`, I used public data from the `POSTMAN Coronavirus COVID19 API` at this [link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#b07f97ba-24f4-4ebe-ad71-97fa35f3b683).
For the dashboard illustrated in the png file: `COVID19 (2).png`, I used public data from the `Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID19 API` at this [link](https://covid19api.com/).
Both dashboards displayed a graph that showed the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore over time.
