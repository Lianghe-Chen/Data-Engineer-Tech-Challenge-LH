## Section 5: Machine Learning

For this section, I used the dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation) to create a machine learning model for predicting the buying price of a car given the following parameters:

- Maintenance = High
- Number of Doors = 4
- Luggage Boot Size = Big
- Safety = High
- Class Value = Good

From the dataset downloaded, I derived three csv files: `car_data.csv`, `car_names.csv` and `car_readme.csv` which contain information about this dataset.
The csv file: `car_train.csv` is a copy of the csv file: `car_data.csv`. I renamed it for use in the machine learning model.
The csv file: `car_test.csv` contains the abovementioned parameters for the car in our test case.

Essentially, I created three machine learning prediction models using the R programming language and RStudio:

1. Classification Tree
2. Generalized Boosted Models
3. Random Decision Forests

There were three files generated by RStudio: `5_Machine_Learning.Rmd`, `5_Machine_Learning.Rproj` and `5_Machine_Learning.html` for this R project.

The csv file: `car_result.csv` is the output derived from one of the machine learning models used for predicting the buying price of a car given the abovementioned parameters.
