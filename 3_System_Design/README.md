## Section 3: System Design

For this section, I created a PowerPoint presentation: `Cloud System Architecture.pptx` on my design of the cloud data infrastructure for a company whose main business is in processing images. For the cloud system architecture and design that I would like to implement, I adapted the ecosystem and best practices from Amazon Web Services (AWS). I referenced the article: `Best Practices for Running Apache Kafka on AWS` published on the `AWS Big Data Blog` at this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/best-practices-for-running-apache-kafka-on-aws/).
